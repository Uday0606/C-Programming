WHAT IS TIME COMPLEXITY?

Time complexity means:
How the number of steps in a program increases as input size (n) increases.

It does NOT mean time in seconds or milliseconds.
It means how many operations (steps / comparisons) are performed.


---- COMMON TIME COMPLEXITIES ----

O(1) – Constant Time
-------------------
The code runs the same number of times, no matter how big n is.

Example:
-Accessing a single array element  arr[0]
-No loops involved.


O(n) – Linear Time
-----------------
The code runs once for each element.

Example:
One loop

for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    // runs n times
}

As n increases, steps increase linearly.


O(n²) – Nested Loop Time
-----------------------
One loop inside another loop.

Example:
for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        // runs n * n times
    }
}

This becomes slow for large inputs.


O(n³) – Triple Nested Loop Time (Rare)
-------------------------------------
Three loops inside each other.

Example:
for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        for(k = 0; k < n; k++)
        {
            // runs n * n * n times
        }
    }
}

Very slow and rarely used in practice.



O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
---------------------------
O(log n) means the number of steps increases very slowly because
the input size is reduced by a constant factor (usually divided by 2)
in every step.

*The problem size becomes smaller very fast.

How to Identify O(log n) in Code:
- The loop variable is divided or multiplied by a constant.
- The input size is halved every iteration.

Common Patterns:
n = n / 2
i = i / 2
i = i * 2

Example:
while(n > 1)
{
    n = n / 2;
}

Each iteration removes half of the remaining work.


BEST, AVERAGE, AND WORST CASE (SEARCHING)
----------------------------------------

Best Case:
Minimum number of steps.
Example: element found at the first index.

Average Case:
Normal number of steps.
Example: element found somewhere in the middle.

Worst Case:
Maximum number of steps.
Example: element found at the last index OR not found.


WHAT IS SPACE COMPLEXITY?

Space complexity means:
How much extra memory an algorithm uses as input size (n) increases.

It does NOT include the memory required for input.
It includes only additional memory used by the program.


COMMON SPACE COMPLEXITIES
-------------------------

O(1) – Constant Space:
--------------------
The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra memory.

Examples:
- Using only variables
- Iterative binary search
- Linear search

Example: int a, b, sum;


O(n) – Linear Space:
------------------
Extra memory grows with input size.

Examples:
- Using an extra array
- Frequency array
- Copying input into another array

Example: int temp[n];


O(log n) – Logarithmic Space
---------------------------
Memory grows with recursion depth.

Examples:
- Recursive binary search
- Recursive tree traversal

Each recursive call uses stack memory.
Even though the number of recursive calls is small, 
it increases as log n when the input size increases,
so the space complexity is O(log n).
