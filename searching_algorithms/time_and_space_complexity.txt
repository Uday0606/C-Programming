WHAT IS TIME COMPLEXITY?

Time complexity means:
How the number of steps in a program increases as input size (n) increases.

It does NOT mean time in seconds or milliseconds.
It means how many operations (steps / comparisons) are performed.


---- COMMON TIME COMPLEXITIES ----

O(1) – Constant Time
-------------------
The code runs the same number of times, no matter how big n is.

Example:
-Accessing a single array element  arr[0]
-No loops involved.


O(n) – Linear Time
-----------------
The code runs once for each element.

Example:
One loop

for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    // runs n times
}

As n increases, steps increase linearly.


O(n²) – Nested Loop Time
-----------------------
One loop inside another loop.

Example:
for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        // runs n * n times
    }
}

This becomes slow for large inputs.


O(n³) – Triple Nested Loop Time (Rare)
-------------------------------------
Three loops inside each other.

Example:
for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        for(k = 0; k < n; k++)
        {
            // runs n * n * n times
        }
    }
}

Very slow and rarely used in practice.



O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
---------------------------
O(log n) means the number of steps increases very slowly because
the input size is reduced by a constant factor (usually divided by 2)
in every step.

*The problem size becomes smaller very fast.

How to Identify O(log n) in Code:
- The loop variable is divided or multiplied by a constant.
- The input size is halved every iteration.

Common Patterns:
n = n / 2
i = i / 2
i = i * 2

Example:
while(n > 1)
{
    n = n / 2;
}

Each iteration removes half of the remaining work.


BEST, AVERAGE, AND WORST CASE (SEARCHING)
----------------------------------------

Best Case:
Minimum number of steps.
Example: element found at the first index.

Average Case:
Normal number of steps.
Example: element found somewhere in the middle.

Worst Case:
Maximum number of steps.
Example: element found at the last index OR not found.
